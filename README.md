# About

This repository is part of a consultation on machine-actionable Data Management Plans (DMPs) performed by the [RDA DMP Common Standards WG]( https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/dmp-common-standards-wg). The vision that this working group works to realise is one where DMPs are developed and maintained in such a way that they are fully integrated into the systems and workflows of the wider research data management environment. To achieve this vision the group develops a common data model with a core set of elements that allows for customisations and extensions using existing standards and vocabularies. 

This GitHub repository has been established to enable the community to contribute suggestions and resources in the open. Please see the guidelines and examples on how to contribute. We suggest that you review the existing tickets first and add to these if your suggestion is related to previously shared ideas and resources. When you have something different to share, proceed to [raise a new issue](https://github.com/RDA-DMP-Common/user-stories/issues).

The call for contributions is open between 09 October 2017 and 30 November 2017. Early input is encouraged to allow time for follow-up discussion.

Further information on our progress will be shared through this repository on an ongoing basis and through the RDA DMP Common Standards WG mailing list: rda-common@rda-groups.org

# Motivation and Goals
The DMPs can only become living documents when they are able to address needs of stakeholders involved in the data research lifecycle. We know that needs of stakeholders change over time. 

For example, in the planning phase researchers can only estimate the amount of data to be produced and can notify repository operators who can reserve space for project outputs. By the end of the project though, dedicated tools can provide exact information on the amount and type of data. This information in turn is needed by repository operators to ingest the data into repository and to provide information to funders that project outputs have been successfully deposited. Machine-actionable DMPs can automate many of these tasks by sending notifications and using tools that automate many of these tasks. 

For this reason we need to understand well the evolving requirements to model them properly. Hence, the explicit goals of this consultation are to identify:
1.	stakeholders at each lifecycle stage
2.	how **available** information changes over the lifetime of a DMP
3.	how **need for** information changes  over the lifetime of a DMP

When talking about research lifecycle we refer to the model developed by the University of Central Florida that can be found [here](http://library.ucf.edu/about/departments/scholarly-communication/research-lifecycle/). It consists of 4 phases (so called cycles):
- planning
- project
- publication
- digital scholarship (sharing and preservation)

# How to contribute?
We would like to ask you to contribute to our repository by providing user stories. Please create one issue for user story.

User stories are short, simple descriptions told from a perspective of a given stakeholder. They typically follow a simple template:

- *As a < stakeholder >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >.* 

For example:
- *As a researcher, I want to inform repository operator on the amount of data in the planning phase, so that they confirm that this is possible.*

- *As a researcher, I want to inform funders that data is available in an open access repository, so that I can receive my last grant payment.*

- *As a funder, I want to have a list of DOIs for articles published within a research project, so that I can track how the grant money was spent.* 

- *As a repository operator, I want to know the embargo periods for ingested data, so that I can restrict access to specific contents and comply with policies.*


Your contributions here are most welcome if they are constructive and made in a friendly manner. Contributing here means that you accept the [licensing terms](https://github.com/RDA-DMP-Common/user-stories/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

Please:
-	formulate the user stories following the template from above
- provide as much context as possible in your description, together with links to relevant resources
  - specify which systems and services use or provide this information
  - indicate to which phase of the lifecycle the user story applies to

Once new issues are submitted, we will assign labels to help us categorise and group the contributions.

We have added some example entries (example 1 and example 2) to give a sense of the kind of contributions you might make.
